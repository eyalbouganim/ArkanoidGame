# 🎮 Arkanoid Game (Java)

An enhanced Arkanoid-style game built in Java, focused on clean Object-Oriented programming principles and design-pattern-based architecture.  
Developed as part of an academic OOP course, featuring multiple levels, score tracking, and modular code structure for future expansion.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ 4 progressively challenging levels  
- ✅ Smooth paddle & ball physics  
- ✅ Scoring system with persistent UI updates  
- ✅ Pause & resume functionality (`P` to pause, `SPACE` to continue`)  
- ✅ Win & Game-Over screens  
- ✅ Easily extendable code structure  
- ✅ Uses the **Observer Design Pattern** for decoupled event handling  
- ✅ Clean OOP design — abstractions, inheritance & encapsulation
